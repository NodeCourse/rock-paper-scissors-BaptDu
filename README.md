# rock-paper-scissors

Build a rock-paper-scissors game composed of two pages.
On the first page, the user should be able to select an option (whether rock, paper or scissors).
When the user choose an option, he should be redirected to another page.
On that page he should see the option he picked, the option the computer picked and if he won, lost or if it's a draw.

Regarding the computer's choice, the idea is to pick a random option from the available ones: rock, paper or scissors.
You will need to use the [random-item](https://www.npmjs.com/package/random-item) module to pick a random item from an array.
